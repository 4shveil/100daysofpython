# 100 Days of Code - The Complete Journey üöÄ

Welcome! This repository documents my entire journey through the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**. I'm taking this course as the first major step towards my desired career in **Cybersecurity**. By mastering Python, my goal is to build my own security tools and develop a deep understanding of the language that powers so much of the digital world. This entire journey was undertaken on an Arch Linux environment, providing a fantastic platform for development and learning. This repository is the living record of that commitment.
