# 100 Days of Code - The Complete Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my repository for the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Angela Yu! This repository is a comprehensive collection of all my work throughout this incredible coding journey. It's organized into three main sections, each representing a different phase of my learning and development.

## üìÇ Daily Projects

This section contains the final project from each day of the course. These projects were instrumental in reinforcing the new concepts I learned daily. Each day brought a new challenge and a new opportunity to build something from scratch.

You'll find a variety of projects here, from simple console applications to more complex programs involving APIs, web scraping, and data processing. Each project is a testament to the daily grind and the small, consistent steps that lead to significant progress.

## üèÜ Capstone Projects

Here, you will find the major capstone projects from the course. These projects were designed to integrate multiple skills and concepts learned over several days. They represent key milestones in the curriculum and are more substantial in scope and complexity than the daily projects.

These capstones are a great way to see how different programming concepts can be combined to create a fully functional application. They were challenging, rewarding, and a fantastic way to solidify my understanding of the material.

## ‚ú® Portfolio-Worthy Projects

This is where I've put my skills to the ultimate test! The projects in this section are from Day 82 to Day 100, where the challenge was to come up with and build my own ideas without direct guidance from Angela. This section, which I've decided to call the **"Innovation Incubator,"** showcases my ability to independently conceptualize, design, and execute projects from start to finish.

These projects are a true reflection of my personal interests and my growth as a developer. They demonstrate my problem-solving abilities and my passion for creating practical and innovative solutions. I'm incredibly proud of the work in this section, and I hope it gives you a glimpse into my potential as a developer.
